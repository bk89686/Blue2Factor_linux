INSTALLING BLUE2FACTOR

Prior to installing Blue2Factor on a server, make sure you have signed up for
Blue2Factor, and have it installed on at least one person's devices. Failure to
do so could cause you to get locked out of the server you are installing it on.


To perform the installation, run the INSTALL program with root privileges
(e.g. sudo ./INSTALL) on the server you want to protect.


After starting the INSTALL program, go to your Blue2Factor admin page at
https://secure.blue2factor.com/company (on a different machine is okay) and
click 'Add Server.'  You will be asked to provide a server Name and a Server
ID. The name is up to you. The Server ID is a code you will be provided while
the INSTALL is running.


The INSTALL program will pause and give you a code.  Enter the code in Server
ID text box that is part of the the 'Add Server' popup on the company page.
Select 'OK' on the popup. Following that, go back to the INSTALL window and
click Return to complete the installation.
